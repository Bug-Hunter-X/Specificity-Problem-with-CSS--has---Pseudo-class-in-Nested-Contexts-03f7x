The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the `:has()` pseudo-class, where the selector's specificity is not working as expected within a nested context:

```css
.container {
  background-color: lightgray;
}

.container :has(> .inner) {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container > .inner {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```

The expected behavior is that the `.container` element with a direct child `.inner` should have a `lightblue` background due to the `:has()` selector, but it only inherits from `.container` and displays `lightgray`. The `lightgreen` background from the direct child is displayed as expected. This occurs because the specificity of `:has()` might be lower than expected in some situations.
